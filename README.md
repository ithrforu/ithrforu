Hello! My name is Vladimir and I am 25 years old.

### My priorities:
1. Programing and solving problems! :)
2. Caring about positive emotions of users and benefits of applications I develop, taking into account the requirements for accessibility and semantics.
3. Be a part of strong and experienced team.
4. Work-learning-life balance.

**My strengths** are curiosity and high quality learning, good communication and teamwork skills due to extensive experience at working with people (organization of events and HR), responsibility and pedantry, the ability to systematically access the work process and think critically.

I have no experience in commercial development, but I have a desire to get it :man_technologist:
