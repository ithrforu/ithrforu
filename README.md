Hello! My name is Vladimir. I am 25 years old and *__my goal__ is to become a frontend developer in 2022*.

### Priorities
1. Programing and solving problems! :)
2. Professional growth (studying engineering thinking, practice on complex tasks, study of frontend technologies and Computer Science).
3. Caring about positive emotions of users and benefits of applications I develop, taking into account the requirements for accessibility and semantics.
4. Be a part of strong and experienced team.
5. Work-learning-life balance.

**My strengths** are curiosity and high quality learning, good communication and teamwork skills due to extensive experience at working with people (organization of events and HR), responsibility and pedantry, the ability to systematically access the work process and think critically.

I have no experience in commercial development, but I have a desire to get it :man_technologist:

### My skills:
* Semantic HTML, Makdown, CSS, basic JavaScript (ES6+)
* PostCSS, SASS/Scss, Less preprocessors, Pug template engine
* BEM methodology
* Gulp
* npm
* Git, GitHub
* Figma, Photoshop
* Experienced Windows user and I have Linux Ubuntu as a working OS.

### Codewars task example:

#### Instructions
*Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number*.

Given `n`, take the sum of the digits of `n`. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

#### Solution

```
function digital_root(n) {
	if (n < 10) {
		return n;
	} else {
		let s = 0;
		while (n > 0) {
			s += n % 10;
			n = Math.floor(n / 10);
		}
		return digital_root(s);;
	}
}

```

At the current moment I learn JS with the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML#prerequisites), studying at the [RSSchool](https://rs.school/js/) frontend course and computer science. Previously I was learning the educational programming language *PascalABC.NET* (С# based language).

I have a completed higher education in HR (bachelor degree) and 1.5 years done of master's HR degree.

**English level** – A2. I read technical documentation in English and communicate on a english speaking forum.
